Question 1:
  - Test 3:
      - downlink 10 3.1 4.0
        When we send a packet from 0 to 4, we can clearly see the bouncing effect between
        router 1 and 2 because packets are continuously sent back and forth in the link 1.1 2.1.
        This happens until the routing protocol converges.

      - downlink 35 0.0 3.0
        This happens without any convergence/counting to infinity issues.

      - downlink 45 2.2 5.0
        Now the network is split into 2 different subnetworks ({0, 1, 2} and {3, 4, 5, 6}).
        So essentially, the protocol will keep looping until it reaches an infinity value.
        Only then it converges. This effect can clearly be seen when the test tries to send a packet
        from router 0 to router 5 at time 50. The packet is sent back and forth on the link 1.1 2.1.

  - Test 4:
    - downlink 15 2.2 5.0
      This happens without any convergence/counting to infinity issues.

    - downlink 30 0.0 3.0
      Again, the network is split into 2 subnetworks ({0, 1, 2} and {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}).
      So the protocol will loop until the metric reaches an infinity value. This can clearly be seen
      when we send a packet from router 7 to router 2 at time 40 because the packet is sent back and forth
      on link 5.2 6.2.

Question 2:
  Split Horizon and Poison Reverse helps to speed up the convergence process in several cases (as seen above with for example counting to infinity).
  It works really well when there are loops with more than 2 routers. If there is a loop with for example 3 routers, it is still possible that they
  need to count to infinity.
  - Test 3:
    - downlink 10 3.1 4.0
      Now when we send a packet from 0 to 4 at time 12, we can see that the packet gets dropped immediately because there isn't a path at that point in time from router 0 to 4
      since the protocol hasn't converged yet. So instead of sending the packet back and forth, SH/PR has resolved the issue.
      The reason why is because if SH/PR is switched off, both router 1 and router 2 receive at the same time that they both can no longer send via router 0 to get to router 4.
      Additionally, router 2 also received a message that it cannot send through router 5 to get to router 4 with metric 2. So the shortest option for router 2 is through router 1 and the shortest option for router 2 is through router 1.
      This causes a packet to be sent back and forth between the 2.

      But when SH/PR is switched on, router 0 doesn't advertise to router 3 that it has a path to router 4 via router 3.
      Therefore router 0 knows at time 12, that there currently isn't a viable path from 0 to 4. So it drops the packet.

    - downlink 35 0.0 3.0
      There previously weren't any noticeable issues so SH/PR couldn't have resolved any.

    - downlink 45 2.2 5.0
      Similar to the downlink 10 3.1 4.0, instead of 0 advertising to 2 that there is a route between 0 and 5 via 2, it sets the metric to infinity.
      Then 2 advertises to routers 0 and 1 that the metric to router 5 is also infinity. Since they both currently send via the same interface that they received this advertisement on,
      they update their routing tables to contain this information.
      So now when router 0 tries to send a message to router 5, it realizes it cannot and therefore drops the packet.

  - Test 4:
    - downlink 15 2.2 5.0
      There previously weren't any noticeable issues so SH/PR couldn't have resolved any.

    - downlink 30 0.0 3.0
      Because SH/PR is turned on, routers 4, 5 and 6 will not advertise a route to router 2 via router 3. So when router 3 advertises that the route to router 2 has metric infinity, they will accept it.
      However router 7 can for example still advertise to router 4 that is has a route to router 2 via router 6 and it will accept it.
      Therefore loops can still be created. A similar loop is created and the packet gets dropped once it reached infinity.
